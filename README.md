This package creates a world in Gazebo and moves a differential-drive robot in the world.

## Quickstart
1. Use `ros2 launch diff_drive ddrive.launch.xml` to start the Gazebo and Rviz simulation
2. Use `ros2 run teleop_twist_key teleop_twist_key` to move the robot (At the moment the flip node is not run the launchfile, but it will be added soon)
